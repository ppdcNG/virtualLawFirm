                LawTrella on an individual basis in arbitration, as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. This will
                preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against LawTrella, and also

                consolidated, or representative action brought against LawTrella by someone else.

                the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other
                equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,

                pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a
                class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of

                and allows users to view their qualifications, location and area of practice. By using a Lawyer account, you
                agree to have your profile listed in LawTrella’s Lawyer directory service (“Find a Lawyer”). You also agree
                that users may find you through your name or your area of specialization or by any other search methods used

            <h4>Calendars</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                LawTrella Lawyer accounts have an inbuilt calendar which is visible to all users of the site (see our
                privacy policy for more on this). The calendar displays a lawyer's available meeting hours and users may
                request a briefing consultation or request to book a follow-up meeting on a Brief.

                The LawTrella platform includes text, call and video conferencing services. By using a LawTrella account,
                you agree to abide by our virtual consulting rules. You can read these rules here.

            <h4>Initial Consultation:</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                By using a LawTrella lawyer account, you agree that users may request an initial consultation with you at
                any of your available meeting hours. You will have the options of (a) accepting the consultation at the
                requested time and day; (b) accepting the consultation and suggesting another available time to the client;
                (c) passing the request to another lawyer; (d) declining the request. If you fail to exercise any of these
                options within 24 hours of the request being made, the request will automatically pass to another lawyer.

            <h4>Engagement of legal services</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                At the end of an initial consultation, a lawyer has the option to accept or decline a Brief. If you choose
                to accept, a Brief will be created on your account in the name of the client. For all intent and purposes, a
                Brief opened on your account creates an Attorney-Client relationship between you and the user in whose name
                it was opened. LawTrella is not a party to that relationship and all communications between the lawyer and
                the client are secured and privileged.

            <h4>Briefs</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                When a Brief is opened between you and a client, you will have access to a set of applications that will
                enable you to communicate with the client and manage certain aspects of the Brief. These may include
                Real-time messaging, Voice call, Video call, Live Interactive Audio and Video Streaming, Recording, File
                Sharing, Billing and Payment. Read our <a href="https://www.lawtrella.com/privacy">privacy policy</a> to

            <h4>Lawyers Deliverables:</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Both parties shall agree on a list of deliverables which will define the scope of work to be done. Scheduled
                payments may or may not be tied to certain deliverables which the Lawyer is expected to meet. When this is
                the case, it is the client’s duty to mark deliverables as received. Notwithstanding a given due date, a
                payment will not become due until the deliverable to which it has been tied has been marked as received.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Rates & Billing:</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                When you use a Lawyer account, you are free to pick any of our Billing methods. When a Brief is created, a
                payment schedule is also created and you are required to input the total sum which the client has been
                charged and the consecutive due dates of each payment. In the case of a retainer, the period covered by the
                total sum will be indicated and the payment schedule will contain the dates when each payment will be due.
                You may freely set rates for your various services. These rates will be visible by all who can view your
                profile (read about profile visibility here). Alternatively, you may choose the option of contingent billing
                in which case, both parties must agree on the total sum to be paid and create a payment schedule.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Payment Schedule</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Under a Brief, either party may create a schedule for payment of costs and fees. The schedule, when
                completed, shall be binding on the client. It shall denote the total financial implication of the Brief and
                any invoice, payment or cost not included in the payment schedule shall not be considered as part of the
                Brief. The payment schedule may be amended by either party but subject to approval of the other party. It is
                your responsibility to ensure that the payment schedule at all times reflects the financial obligations of
                the client. It is the client's duty to make payment as at when due.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Additional fees</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                After the parties have agreed on a total sum, you may request additional fees in the event that a
                modification is made to the Brief’s deliverables or there is any other unforeseen change in circumstances.
                Any additional fees requested by you and accepted by the client will be reflected in the total sum and
                included in the payment schedule.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Invoices</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                When a scheduled payment becomes due, you are required to send an invoice for it and clients will be
                required to make payments on those invoices. Each invoice has a unique reference number. Use this number if
                you need to report an outstanding payment.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Payments</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Billing can occur anytime while a Brief is open. You may send an invoice to a client for the payment of
                costs and fees either at the opening of a Brief, or anytime prior to it’s closing. If an invoice remains
                unsettled for up to 72 hours after it has become due, you may make a complaint to LawTrella.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Tax</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Applicable Taxes shall be included in the total sum.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Modifications and/or Revisions to deliverables</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Should a client request any modifications and/or changes be made to the terms of a deliverable, such
                modifications and/or changes must be agreed to by the Lawyer. You may accept the modification, simply, or
                you may accept the modification with a request for additional fees. Such additional fees must be accepted by
                the client before the modification will be reflected in the deliverables.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cancellation Policy</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                In the event that a client requests to delete a deliverable prior to its due date, you will have the option
                of accepting the deletion. In which case, you may make an amendment to the payment schedule. If you choose
                to reject a cancellation request, a complaint will automatically be created and information relating to the
                request may be accessed by LawTrella. Any payment tied to the deliverable will be suspended pending the
                determination of the review. You may be required to make a defence to LawTrella in order to ascertain the
                expended costs associated with the deliverable and the relevant charges that may be made on those costs
                before the cancellation can be accepted.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Closing a Brief</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                A client may request to close a brief at any time after it is opened. It is the lawyer’s duty to ensure that
                all outstanding deliverables and invoices have been settled. By closing a Brief, you affirm that the work
                has been completed to the client’s satisfaction. Note that by closing a Brief, you acknowledge that all
                outstanding invoices have been settled. LawTrella will not permit you to demand any fees, reimbursements or
                charges of any sort after a brief has been closed.
